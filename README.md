# Introduction

TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project.

## Getting Started

Install Node.js LTS Release
Install Expo CLI using command "npm install -g expo-cli" inside the folder

rm -rf node_modules
npm install

## Build and Test

TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.

Notes for profile screen: currently the profile screen is barebones, but correctly pulls up all the user's data. The edit profile screen is currently disabled, due to problems getting the change email function in firebase working. It changes the email everywhere except for the user's identity, meaning you still have to log in using the original email.
